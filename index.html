                    <h2>About Your Web Developer</h2>
                    <p>When I was a kid, I loved to draw. I'd sit at a desk and come up with fantasies in my head, then try to draw them
                        like they were a frame in the scene of a movie. Afterwards, I would imagine how the next scene would look and update the picture to try to make it
                         look like the new scene. <br><br>Computer Programming wasn't nearly as popular or accessible to learn about then as it is today, so for me, I think that
                          was my way of trying to be a designer with a sheet of paper and a box of crayons.<br><br>
                           I didn't begin learning to code until high school. I started on Codecademy with html and css, but didn't take it too seriously until I
                         began college. Those free courses online were what I used to start learning web development; that was the first time I'd ever built my own webpage
                          from scratch.<br><br> However, I didn't begin to truly enjoy coding until I started learning Javascript, my first official programming 
                         language. Ever since then, I've experienced nothing less than fun and fulfillment from learning to build my own webpages and programs.<br><br>
                          Everything that I know about web development came from online courses and practicing in my free time. I know that I have alot more to learn, 
                          but I'm confident in my ability to deliver quality results to anyone who wants to work with me.

                <p>These are early recreations of popular webpages that I've coded from scratch for practice. They are projects that I have worked on at the beginning
                     of my programming journey, so they weren't made with responsive web design in mind. The links in the recreations will take you to the actual website,
                     but they aren't meant to be a substitute for the sites that these pages belong to. They are only for display.</p>

                <p>These are the skills and platforms that I have experience with. Click the icons below to learn more about the programming languages
                    associated with them.</p>

                    <li id="html-icon-box"> <i class="fa-brands fa-html5"> </i> <strong>HTML</strong> <br><br>
                         <span>Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is a markup language used to outline the structure of a webpage. You can think of it like the skeleton
                         of a website. HTML is the language that introduced me to coding and web development. It's one of the simpler languages to understand, and the
                         one that I have the most experience with.
                         </span>
                    </li>
                    <li id="css-icon-box"> <i class="fa-brands fa-css3"></i> <strong>CSS</strong> <br><br>
                         <span>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a style sheet language used to outline the design and presentation of a webpage written in a markup language.
                         CSS can be used to add color, edit font, change the position of elements on the screen, or make webpages responsive to different screen sizes.
                         Even though it's fairly simple to understand, it is a bit more complicated to learn than a markup language like html.
                         </span>
                    </li>
                    <li id="javascript-icon-box"> <i class="fa-brands fa-js"></i> <strong>Javascript</strong> <br><br>
                         <span>Javascript, or JS, is the primary programming language used for website behavior. It adds interactivity to a webpage or application's
                          client-side, but can be used on the server-side as well. Javascript is more difficult to learn than html or css, but once you do, the
                          creativity that you have has made it the most fun language to learn for me. The combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript are
                           what comprise front-end web development.
                         </span>
                    </li>
                    <li id="git-icon-box"> <i class="fa-brands fa-git"></i> <strong>Git</strong> <br><br>
                         <span>Git is a version control system, or VCS, used for keeping track of different versions of files. Git allows programmers to collaborate on
                         different projects while keeping track of the changes made throughout. Changes to files are stored and saved on multiple branches that can be
                         accessed by different programmers in a hierarchal file system structure. Git was a little confusing for me to understand at first, but in
                        time I began to learn how to use it and appreciate it's value.
                         </span>
                    </li>
                    <li id="github-icon-box"> <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> <strong>Github</strong> <br><br>
                         <span>Github is an online platform for programmers to store, manage and share their code using Git. There are repositories, or folders, available
                         on Gitub that developers can use to share projects, get feedback on new developments, or even host their own online portfolio site. I am still learning
                         how to use some of the features on Github but I can't understate it's value. After all, it's the platform that I'm using to display my own portfolio site.
                         </span></li>
                    <li id="node-icon-box"> <i class="fa-brands fa-node-js"></i> <strong>Node.js</strong> <br><br>
                         <span>Node.js is a cross-platform tool that's used as a Javascript runtime environment. Or in other words, it lets programmer run javascript
                         outside of a web browser on different operating systems. Node.js is what allows developers to use javascript to write server-side code. Majority of my
                         experience with javascript has been client-side, or front-end, but I have occasionally used Node.js along-side Git Bash to test code outside 
                         of a browser environment.
