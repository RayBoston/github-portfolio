                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>When I was a kid, I loved to draw. I'd sit at a desk and come up with fantasies in my head, then try to draw them
                        like they were a frame in the scene of a movie. Afterwards, I would imagine how the next scene would look and update the picture to try to make it
                         look like the new scene. <br><br>Computer Programming wasn't nearly as popular or accessible to learn about then as it is today, so for me, I think that
                          was my way of trying to be a designer with a sheet of paper and a box of crayons.<br><br>
                           I didn't begin learning to code until high school. I started on Codecademy with html and css, but didn't take it too seriously until I
                         began college. Those free courses online were what I used to start learning web development; that was the first time I'd ever built my own webpage
                          from scratch.<br><br> However, I didn't begin to truly enjoy coding until I started learning Javascript, my first official programming 
                         language. Ever since then, I've experienced nothing less than fun and fulfillment from learning to build my own webpages and programs.<br><br>
                          Everything that I know about web development came from online courses and practicing in my free time. I know that I have alot more to learn, 
                          but I'm confident in my ability to deliver quality results to anyone who wants to work with me.
