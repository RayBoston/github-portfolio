                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>When I was a kid I would always love to draw. I would sit at my desk and come up with these different fantasy scenarios in my head and draw them out
                    like they were in the scene of a movie. Then, in my head I would play out how the scene would go and update the picture as I went. Coding and
                     programming weren't nearly as popular and accessible as it is now, so I think that was my way of trying to code as a kid with a sheet of paper and 
                     a box of crayons.<br><br> I didn't start to learn to code until I was in high school, I started learning html and css but didn't really take it seriously 
                     until I got to college. The free courses on Codecademy.com were what I used to learn web development, and that was my first introduction into 
                     learning how to build my own webpages from the ground up. However, it wasn't until I began learning Javascript, my first official programming 
                     language, that I really fell in love with coding and programming.<br><br> Everything that I know about web development are skills that I developed in my 
                     free time, and although I'm no expert just yet, I'm confident in my ability to deliver a quality product to anyone who entrusts me to do so.

                <h2>My Replicas</h2>
                <p>I've recreated popular webpages on the web from scratch to practice my coding skills. None of these webpages are meant to be a substitute for the
                     actual websites that these pages belong to. They are only for display.</p>
