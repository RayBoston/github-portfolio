                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>When I was a kid, I loved to draw. I'd sit at a desk and come up with fantasies in my head, then try to draw them
                        like they were a frame in the scene of a movie. Afterwards, I would imagine how the next scene would look and update the picture to try to make it
                         look like the new scene. <br><br>Computer Programming wasn't nearly as popular or accessible to learn about then as it is today, so for me, I think that
                          was my way of trying to be a designer with a sheet of paper and a box of crayons.<br><br>
                           I didn't begin learning to code until high school. I started on Codecademy with html and css, but didn't take it too seriously until I
                         began college. Those free courses online were what I used to start learning web development; that was the first time I'd ever built my own webpage
                          from scratch.<br><br> However, I didn't begin to truly enjoy coding until I started learning Javascript, my first official programming 
                         language. Ever since then, I've experienced nothing less than fun and fulfillment from learning to build my own webpages and programs.<br><br>
                          Everything that I know about web development came from online courses and practicing in my free time. I know that I have alot more to learn, 
                          but I'm confident in my ability to deliver quality results to anyone who wants to work with me.

                <h2>My Replicas</h2>
                <p>These are early recreations of popular webpages that I've coded from scratch for practice. They are projects that I have worked on at the beginning
                     of my programming journey, so they weren't made with responsive web design in mind. The links in the recreations will take you to the actual website,
                     but they aren't meant to be a substitute for the sites that these pages belong to. They are only for display.</p>
